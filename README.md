During the development of this project, I learned to:

* Implement a system for adding and removing products, as well as updating item quantities in the cart.
* Combine Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve a more dynamic design.
* Adopt a mobile-first approach to ensure the interface looks great on devices of all sizes.
